                    <h2>What is the dataLayer?</h2>
                    <p class="ingress">The dataLayer is another word for "a place to record and store things people do on your website".</p>
                    <img src="../resources/images/the-datalayer.png" alt="Image of a dataLayer ojbect, a browser and references to what it is"/>
                    <center><a href="../resources/images/the-datalayer.png">Click to enlarge image</a></center>
                    <h3>Sample of what it looks like when accessed through the browser</h3>
                    <img src="../resources/images/lyko-datalayer.png" alt="Image of dataLayer screen print from lyko.se"/>
                    <p>These things are stored in the dataLayer that exist in your browser before collected and sent to places like analytics, facebook or elsewhere.</p>
                    <h3>Why the chunky L?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The data<strong>L</strong>ayer is spelled with a capital L because om something called "camel case with a lowercase first letter" - which essentially means you combine words that would have otherwise been written separately, but in order to make them readable you capitalize the first letter of every word - except for the first one.
                        <ul>
                            <li>dataLayer</li>
                            <li>reallyCoolSomething</li>
                            <li>addEventListener</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Events = everything people do</h2>
                    <p>Everything users do on your website are registered as events.</p>
                    <p>Imagine the user landing on your website. This generates a page_view event. They click a button which generates a click event. They add a product to their cart which activates the add_to_cart event.</p>
                    <p>IF and only IF you have added code to your website that tells it to register those events.</p>
                    <p>You thus have to add code to your website to create events in the dataLayer.</p>
                    <p>If the events aren't recorded, they cannot be collected.</p>
                    <h3>Collected via tags</h3>
                    <p>So let's say you have added the code that push a few events to the dataLayer.</p>
                    <p>Now you can use tags (other small scripts) that tells the browser where to send these events.</p>
                    <p>If you use Google Tag Manager (or similar alternatives), they make it really easy to add these kinds of tags.</p>
                    <p>In fact, the dataLayer is a brain-child of the people at Google and something that GTM standardised. Which is nice.</p>
                    <p>Just remember that it is one place to store things in the browser. But there are several other I'm going to go through on this site.</p>
